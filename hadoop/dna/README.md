# hadoop-dna
The goal of this MapReduce design is to produce the average protein size in a series of DNA sequences.

**_NOTES_**
1. *In this example, each DNA sequence includes one hundred nucleotides (letters), and the mapping process does not assume that each protein needs to include at least one and whole number of codons (nucleotide triplets).*
1. *Mochadoop is used as a medium of testing*
